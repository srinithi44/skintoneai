# ✨ AI Beauty Studio — Makeup Analysis & Recommendation System

A premium, full-stack AI platform designed to provide personalized beauty insights. This application uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning to analyze skin tones, provide dataset-aware recommendations, fetch live weather-based tips, and quantify make-up transformations.

## 🚀 Quick Start (No Docker)

### 1. Clone and Set Up Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# add your OpenWeather API key to .env
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. (Optional) Train the Model
If you have a `training_data/` folder with subfolders `Fair`, `Medium`, and `Dark`, you can retrain the CNN:
```bash
python model/train_model.py
```

### 3. Start Backend
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. Set Up Frontend
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the App
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
